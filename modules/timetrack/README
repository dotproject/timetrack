  Summary:
    TimeTrack is intended to be a time tracking module for DotProject.
    It will NOT work in a stand-alone mode, don't even ask.
	
	>>>>>>> NOTE THAT THIS IS CONSIDERED _ALPHA_ SOFTWARE <<<<<<<<<<<
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	
    Currently it can:
      - automatically generate new timesheets
      - view all of a users timesheets
      - modify each timesheet entry
      - automatically pull up user tasks
      - keep track of timesheet notes
      - input ad-hoc tasks
      - submit a timesheet for review
      - look at static, archived timesheets
	  - Project manager review tools
      - Supervisor review tools
    
    What's missing:
      
      - Reporting of any kinds (you can always print it... ;-)

    Time tracking is basically project/task driven.  You need to be of user type 6 or lower to view 
	other peoples timesheets.  
	
    Each timesheet has rows that reflect a particular task, and the rows can be edited or 
    deleted.  Note that while you can delete rows, you CANNOT delete a timesheet.  This is done
    purpose.

    There is NO support.
