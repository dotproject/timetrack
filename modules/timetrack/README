  Summary:
    TimeTrack is intended to be a time tracking module for DotProject.
    It will NOT work in a stand-alone mode, don't even ask.
	
	>>>>>>> NOTE THAT THIS IS CONSIDERED _ALPHA_ SOFTWARE <<<<<<<<<<<
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	
    Currently it can:
      - automatically generate new timesheets
      - view all of a users timesheets
      - modify each timesheet entry
      - automatically pull up user tasks
      - keep track of timesheet notes
      - input ad-hoc tasks
      - submit a timesheet for review
      - look at static, archived timesheets
	  - Project manager review tools
      - Supervisor review tools
    
    What's missing:
      
      - Reporting of any kinds (you can always print it... ;-)

    You can get the newest version at http://dotmods.sourceforge.net.

// BEGIN... DEPRECATED INSTALL NOTES (27 Feb 2003):
  Installation:
    Untar/gzip the distro into you dotproject/modules directory.
	
    Put functions/timesheet.php in your 
    [dotproject root]/functions directory 
	
    Update your current MySQL dotproject db by using the timetrack.sql file in the 
    sql directory.
	
    Create a link from one of the other dotproject pages to:
	
	index.php?m=timetrack
	
	Add timetrack to your permissions array in modules/admin/vw_usr_perms.php
	
    and you should be ready to go.
// END... DEPRECATED INSTALL NOTES

// NEW INSTALL (with dotproject version 1.0 alpha):
// NOTE: The TimeTrack Module does not currently work with dotproject1.0 alpha,
// but this will get you "mostly" there....
1) Download and unpack the TimeTrack Module
2) Place the "timetrack" folder into the dotproject /modules folder.
3) Login to DotProject as an Admin and go into the System Administration | Modules directory
4) Install, Activate, and Make Visible the "TimeTrack" module

That's it... right now, the "New Timesheet" button doesn't work, but atleast it is "sort of" installed.

IGNORE the SQL folder and timetrack.sql file [setup.php takes care of this].
Do NOT install the /classdefs/timetrack.php file [it will crash your system].


  ChangeLog:
    Now in ChangeLog

  Documentation:
    Time tracking is basically project/task driven.  You need to be of user type 6 or lower to view 
	other peoples timesheets.  
	
    Each timesheet has rows that reflect a particular task, and the rows can be edited or 
    deleted.  Note that while you can delete rows, you CANNOT delete a timesheet.  This is done
    purpose.

  Support:
    There is NO support.
